# Exercises

This document contains exercises for the TCM Academy course "Linux 101."  It is provided as a supplement to the course for additional experience.

## Getting Started

### Getting Help on the Command Line

1. Why is there no man page or info for the command to change directories `cd`?  We will discuss this later in the course, but this information is good to know now.  Note that some distributions may have a man page for the command, but most do not.  While Linux Mint does not have a man page for cd, there is a help page for it.

### Command Line Arguments and Options
1. Using the man page for the `ls` command, create commands that accomplish the following:
    - List the contents of a directory sorted by size while displaying the size in human-readable format
    - List the contents of directory sorted by the last modification time
    - List the contents of the current directory using a long listing format and recursively list the contents of all sub-directories.
1. Using the man page for the `hostname` command, create commands that accomplish the following:
    - Display any aliases associated with your current host.
    - Display the IP address associated with your current host.
    - Display all IP addresses associated with your current host.  Is there a difference between the results for this command and the previous one?  If so, why?

### Looking at Text Files: more and less
1. Use the less command to look at the provided file `wordlist.txt`.  How do you search for "oop"?  Test your search by moving forwards and backwards through the results.
1. Use the less command to look at the provided file `shakespeare.txt`.  How do you search for "thou"?  Test your search by moving forwards and backwards through the results.

### Another Way to Look at Text Files: cat
1. Demonstrate a command to concatenate the output from the file `example2.txt` in the `dir1` sub-directory, the file `random-numbers.txt` in the current directory, and the file `test-1237735244.txt` in the `dir-test` subdirectory to the screen.  Every output line should be numbered and end of lines should be indicated by the `$` symbol.

## Files and Filesystems

### Absolute and Relative Paths
1. How can you tell the difference between a relative and an absolute path?
1. Assume your current working directory is `/var/log`.  Demonstrate a command to change the current working directory to your home directory using an absolute path and another command that uses a relative path.
1. Assume you are in your home directory.  Demonstrate a command to change the current working directory to `/etc/init.d` using an absolute path and another command that uses a relative path.  Now, assume you are a different user and the current directory is that user’s home directory.  Which, if any, of the previous commands would be different?  Why or why not?

### Working with Files and Directories
1. Assume the following files are in the current working directory:

        $ls
        bak1    bak2a    file1     file3    file4c      test
        bak3    file2    file3a    notes    test-old

    Demonstrate commands to accomplish the following tasks using as few characters as possible:
    - List the `file1`, `file2`, and `file3` files only
    - List the `notes` file only
    - List the `file1`, `file3`, `bak1`, and `bak3` files
1. Demonstrate a command to create a new directory `course` that is a sub-directory of the current working directory and a `students` directory that is a sub-directory of the `course` directory in a single command.
1. Demonstrate a command to copy the file `example1.txt` from the sub-directory `project` to the sub-directory `backup` while changing the name of the file to `example-backup1.txt`.
1. Demonstrate a command to move the file `example2.txt` from the sub-directory `project` to the sub-directory `backup` while changing the name of the file to `example-backup2.txt`.
1. Demonstrate a command to create an empty file named `my file.txt` (note the space).  Demonstrate a command to move the file to the subdirectory `backup`.  How were these commands different from previous ones in which the file had no space?
1. Demonstrate a command to create an empty file named `-h` (note the dash).  Demonstrate a command to move the file to the subdirectory `backup`.

### Foreground and Background Processes
1. Start two (2) `xclock` processes in the background.  One should use a digital display and the other should use an analog display.  What series of commands do this?  Note: xclock is installed by default in Linux Mint.  If your distribution does not have it by default, you will need to install it to test this command.
1. Start a graphical text editor process as a normal foreground process.  Linux Mint has xed installed by default and CentOS has gedit installed by default.  Use the one appropriate for your system.  What will suspend the editor process?
1. List all the current processes of the shell.  Note that this is not the same as previous process listings and is tied to shell processes.
1. Resume execution of the text editor as a background process.
1. Move the text editor from a background process to a foreground process.

### Scheduling Processes with Crontab
1. Add a cron job for your user that will append the current time to the file `time.txt` that is located in your home directory.  The job should run every minute.  Submit both the commands needed to create the job and the file after the job has run for at least five minutes.  When finished, don’t forget to remove the cron job.
